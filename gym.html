    <p>If you’re looking for easy to use exercise equipment that targets your upper body, then you should try out the chest press machine. This machine involves you sitting upright and you using your arms to push a load with a weight plate away from your chest and back to where you are. Compared to other types of machines, a chest press machine allows you to utilize lifting heavy weights with full support and control!</p>
    <h4>MUSCLES USED</h4>
    <p>Using a chest press, you get specifically target and work out your chest, biceps, back, deltoids and shoulders. It’s often hard to predict what will be used in your workout as the areas targeted can differ due to the model of the chest press and the angle you’re sitting to use it. Most of the time, this machine causes an even workout across all of your upper body.</p>
    <h4>HOW TO USE</h4>
    <p>Using the chest press machine is really easy; all you need to do is set it upright and follow these simple steps:</p>
    <p>1. Adjust the seat of the chest press so the handles line up to your chest height.</p>
    <p>2. Add your weights; ideally, it’s best you begin with 25% of your body weight.</p>
    <p>3. Press the foot pedal with your legs so the handles move to the starting position.</p>
    <p>4. Keep your back against the padding of the chair and push the handles out, but don’t lock your elbows! Make sure when you’re doing this, you exhale.</p>
    <p>5. Inhale and pull the handles back towards your chest.</p>
    <h4>SUITABLE FOR</h4>
    <p>Commercial Gyms – this is an effective workout that is often the most suitable for a commercial gym, but not for home use, as the machine tends to be quite bulky in size. If you have the space in your home, you can also have this machine, but many people try to do without it by using different types of free weight, dumbbell or a barbell for a chest press.</p>
    <h4>WHO SHOULD USE IT?</h4>
    <p>The chest press machine allows you to increase the size and strength of your chest. Therefore if you’re a bodybuilder, rugby player, football player, hockey player, martial artist, and wrestler, this can be a good machine to add to your chest muscle and strengthen it. Basically, if you take part in a sport or work in a profession that requires a lot of pushing and heavy moving, this will benefit you.</p>
    <h4>PRICE</h4>
    <p>This machine can cost between $800-$3000 and is rated 3/5.</p>
    <h4>VERSATILITY RATING</h4>
    <p>We’d give this rating a 3/5 as you can only do the chest incline and decline. However, it does effectively target lots of upper body while you workout.</p>
